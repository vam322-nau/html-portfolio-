Viviana Mendoza: Hello! My name is Viviana Megoso.

3
00:00:09.813 --> 00:00:12.929
Viviana Mendoza: So for my 1st homework

4
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.329
Viviana Mendoza: I decided to

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.020
Viviana Mendoza: let me share my screen.

6
00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:22.769
Viviana Mendoza: You know what I will start with the code first.st

7
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.770
Viviana Mendoza: So this is my code.

8
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:39.166
Viviana Mendoza: so what I did was I made the website part first, st and then the root element, which is the HTML.

9
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:51.719
Viviana Mendoza: And then I had. This is my head element, and the web page title, is my personal portfolio portfolio, using HTML text formatting element.

10
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.920
Viviana Mendoza: And so what I did.

11
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.900
Viviana Mendoza: this is the body of my whole website.

12
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:08.959
Viviana Mendoza: My heading is my name with a 1st pitch. My 1st web page as the title.

13
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.013
Viviana Mendoza: and then for my subtext is the programmer and personal trainer.

14
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:31.030
Viviana Mendoza: And then my contact information which I used h. 1 for this for my main, the subtext h. 2 and then h. 3, as contact information. Whereas it's not

15
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.050
Viviana Mendoza: super important, but or it is important, but more under

16
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.199
Viviana Mendoza: the level

17
00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:43.920
Viviana Mendoza: and then I used br to break it, or

18
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:53.220
Viviana Mendoza: to make it into 4 different lines, just so I could have like a more neater look. And then I added, horizontal

19
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.040
Viviana Mendoza: fine for right here. Let me go into

20
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.590
Viviana Mendoza: the page

21
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.219
Viviana Mendoza: so we can.

22
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.479
Viviana Mendoza: Okay, and here is my website.

23
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.490
Viviana Mendoza: so.

24
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.289
Viviana Mendoza: as you can see on my web page, I have my

25
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:34.099
Viviana Mendoza: 1st name, last name, 1st web page and then programmer and personal trainer as my aspirations in the future.

26
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.440
Viviana Mendoza: My contact information, as you can tell.

27
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.379
Viviana Mendoza: And then right here is where the horizontal

28
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.439
Viviana Mendoza: fine is that.

29
00:02:44.959 --> 00:03:02.410
Viviana Mendoza: and then I have a small description of myself which I use a paragraph. So it starts from here and ends here, and then right here after my goal to be working for apple in 10 years

30
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.710
Viviana Mendoza: time making programs ends

31
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:16.280
Viviana Mendoza: right here. I made it in bold because that is my goal to work at Apple. Maybe that will change in 10 years times, but

32
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.550
Viviana Mendoza: as of right now, that is my goal.

33
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:29.530
Viviana Mendoza: and then. So my next heading, which is my education and experience, as you can tell, I don't have much.

34
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.720
Viviana Mendoza: and that is why I did like a small brief paragraph to give you a description, or like a brief summary of what it is.

35
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:50.189
Viviana Mendoza: And yeah, then the end of my body and the end of Htmf, and that is my website as of

36
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.880
