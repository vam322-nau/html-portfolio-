            My name is Viviana, I am a thrid year student and my major is Software Emgineering at NAU.
            I, unfortunately don't have any experience besides the classes I am taking here at nau.
            I have always been fascinated by how the internent and webstites work. 
            <b>My goal is to work for Apple 
            in 10 years time making programs.</b>
